dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart


# Line 3
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

# Line 4
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

4.Restart your computer to finish the installation.

5.Open up another powershell instance as an admin and type in `wsl --status` to check if you are on version 2, if not follow the [WSL2 invalid machine configuration troubleshooting](#wsl2-invalid-machine-configuration-troubleshooting) steps before continuing to step 6

6.Run the "Ubuntu" application to complete the installation and set up the UNIX user.

7.Make sure to remember the password you set, as you will need it frequently in the future.

8.Right click the top of your ubuntu window and go to `properties`

a. Make sure to click the box that says `use Ctr + Shift + C/V as Copy/Paste`
b. This will make it easier to copy stuff over to your ubuntu terminal both now and in the future

## Install some WSL Packages

1.Run the command `sudo apt update` to fetch the available software updates from index.

2.Run the command `sudo apt upgrade` to upgrade all the installed packages to their lates versions.

3.Install some useful packages using this command

This will install some packages that you will need later on in this course.

`sudo apt install zsh unzip git`

4.Change default shell to zsh

This will make your terminal look nicer, and give you some free cool shit when you are using github later on in this course.

`chsh -s $(which zsh)`

5.Restart Ubuntu

6.Install Bun

Bun is a Javascript Runtime that will be helpful for debugging once you start learning Javascript.

Run the following in your terminal

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

7.Install Node

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | zsh`

## Setup VSCode to Work With WSL

1.In VSCode Install WSL Plugin

Go to the extension store in VSCode and download the WSL extension. It should be produced by microsoft and have over 20M downloads

This is extremely important, and will let you use VSCode with your WSL for Linux

That's it for this one ðŸ˜ƒ

To test to see if it worked, go into your Ubuntu terminal and type in `which code`

As long as it doesn't say `command not found "code"` or something like that, then you are good to go âœ…

## Install zgen

Run this command to clone down the files for zgen

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen.git "${HOME}/.zgen"
```

ZGen will make your terminal much nicer looking. Watch what happens after running a few commands.

To finish this installation, let's open our `zsh` configuration file by typing the following in Ubuntu

```zsh
code ~/.zshrc
```

Then you will copy and paste the following contents into the `.zshrc` configuration file and hit save

```zsh
source "${HOME}/.zgen/zgen.zsh"

zgen prezto
prompt steeef

# bun completions
[ -s "/root/.bun/_bun" ] && source "/root/.bun/_bun"

# bun
export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
# This loads nvm bash_completion
```

1. Launch VSCode and open the new VSCode terminal.
2. Click the dropdown menu next to the "plus" icon and select "Select default Profile". 14. Choose "Ubuntu (WSL)" from the list.

## NodeJS

Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, making it particularly well-suited for applications that require real-time communication and data-intensive tasks. Node.js enables developers to write server-side code using JavaScript, which reduces the complexity of having separate client-side and server-side languages. It has a vibrant ecosystem with a wide range of libraries and frameworks, which makes it a popular choice for web and network application development.

### Instructions to install Node.js with NVM

1. Launch the Ubuntu app.
2. Run the command `nvm install v18.17.1` to install the latest long term support version of Node.js.

#### Test your Node.js installation

## GIT

GIT is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes, collaborate on projects, and manage source code effectively. It provides a way to keep a history of changes made to files, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed. GIT's decentralized architecture allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, independently making changes and merging them seamlessly. It also supports branching, which enables developers to work on separate features or experiments without affecting the main project, and later merge those branches back together. GIT has become an essential tool for software development, enabling teams to work collaboratively, track changes, and ensure code integrity.

GIT is already included in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), so there is no need for a separate installation. However, you may still need to configure GIT to work properly within the WSL environment and Github remote repos.

### Instructions to configure GIT

We've already installed Git earlier when we ran `sudo apt install xxx xxx git`. Git was one of the pieces of software that our package manager `apt` was installing.

Please verify that it is there by typing in.

`which git`

As long as it doesn't say 'Command Not Found' we're good to go

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/signup).
2. Open an Ubuntu Terminal (May be easier to copy / paste inside of VSCode)
3. Run the command `git config --global user.name "John Doe"` to set the default user name. **Make sure that you change this text to match your username that you used for github.**
4. Run the command `git config --global user.email name@domain.zone` to set the default email, which should match the email used during GitHub sign-up.**Make sure that you change this text to match your email that you used for github.**

5. Run the command `git config user.name` to verify that the user name is set correctly.
6. Run the command `git config user.email` to verify that the user email is set correctly.

### Instructions to set the SSH key for GITHUB

1. Launch the Ubuntu application.
2. Follow the [Generate new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux) instructions to generate a new SSH key. Be sure to omit the "Generating a new SSH key for a hardware security key" section.
3. Follow the [Add a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?platform=linux&tool=webui) instructions to add a new SSH key to your GitHub account.

#### Test your SSH connection to Github

Run the command `ssh -T git@github.com` to test your connection to GitHub. Wait wor the message "Hi user.name! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."
